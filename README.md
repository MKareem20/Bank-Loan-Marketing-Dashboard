1-Project Information
 Project Title: Predictive Analytics for Banking Campaign Effectiveness Using Power BI.
 Course/Track: Data Science/Business Intelligence.

2. Project Overview
 Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze a Portuguese banking institution's telephonic marketing campaigns
and identify the factors that contribute to successful term deposit subscriptions. By leveraging Power BI, we
aim to provide data-driven insights into customer profiles, campaign effectiveness, and financial behaviors that
affect subscription rates.
 Scope of Work:
The scope includes the exploration and analysis of a large dataset (45,211 rows) comprising customer
demographics, financial details, and marketing interactions. Using Power BI, we will generate visual insights
that can guide future marketing strategies and optimize campaign efficiency.
 Expected Outcomes:
• A comprehensive dashboard displaying customer profiles, financial behaviors, and campaign
effectiveness.
• Insights into key predictors of term deposit subscriptions, such as job type, balance, and contact
duration.
• Recommendations for optimizing telephonic marketing campaigns, including ideal customer profiles
and optimal contact frequency.
3. Problem Statement
Telephonic marketing remains one of the most effective channels for selling term deposits, but it also demands
significant financial investment. Identifying customers with a high likelihood of subscribing to term deposits is
crucial for cost-effective targeting. The challenge is to predict which customers will subscribe based on
demographic, financial, and interaction data.
